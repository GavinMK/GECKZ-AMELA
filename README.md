# Project Amela

This project is a multimedia streaming website designed after popular streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime.
It utilized an AWS instance, MySQL database, and Django web framework.
Due to the cost of renting an AWS instance, the website is no longer online, but the code remains in this repository.

To see an overview of the project and what it looked like while it was running, please view the Amela Project Overview
PowerPoint in the root directory of this repository.
