# Project Amela

This project is a multimedia streaming website designed after popular streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime.
It utilized an AWS instance, MySQL database, and Django web framework.
Due to the cost of renting an AWS instance, the website is no longer online, but the code remains in this repository.
